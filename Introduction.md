# Introduction #

Welcome to the Simple Telephone Control Panel wiki. This is a project that's been setup to help new telephone service providers get up and running quicker and with more speed than currently available. The entire system is based on FreeSwitch, with a fully fledged PHP 5 and MySQL 5 front-end for staff and customers.

The introduction says it all really. The Simple Telephone Control Panel is designed to help every small business looking to start their own IP PBX service for small and medium businesses all over the UK and Europe.

The entire platform is based on PHP and MySQL, with other languages interspersed as necessary. Several modules for FreeSwitch will be developed in other languages, and database transition modules will need to be built to cope with the many and varied different systems which will need to be put together in order to ensure this system is viable for everyone that uses it.

Developing a system of this magnitude requires thousands of hours of development time from many different highly skilled developers, coupled with thousands of hours of testing with many different hardware platforms to ensure this system works on as broad a range of hardware and software configurations as possible.

As a result I urge you to either donate an hour of development time, or server equipment so that we are able to move this project forward so that it can benefit the whole community.
