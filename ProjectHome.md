This control panel is specifically designed for people who want to launch their own SIP based telephony across 3 IPPBX's handling the call volume.

Once fully set-up the system

Some advanced system configuration will be required, the system is based on the FreeSwitch PBX built on top of a CENTOS 5.5 x64 platform.

We are always looking for developers to help us with the development of the platform, and if you can't develop yourself, then why not donate some money to us so that we can buy the hardware and hosting to test our platform fully?
